Whenever a power-on reset occurs, System Initialization shall [SRS194] perform the following functions.  
As part of System Initialization , the Boot ROM shall [SRS234] be configured to, after completing IBIT, call the manufacturer-supplied VxWorks Board Support Package (BSP) initialization software followed by a call to the FTSS System Initialization software.

System Initialization shall [SRS010] configure the FCP virtual group to use all available synchronized processors, if at least 3 of the 5 FCRs are active.
If any of the FCP processors are not synchronized, System Initialization in the surviving triplex shall [SRS177] attempt to sync with the failed FCP.
If the failed FCP processor has not synced in 2.5 seconds after the surviving triplex has detected the loss of the FCP, then the surviving triplex shall [SRS178], within 1 second, send a single voted VMEbus reset through the NE to the failed FCP.
System Initialization shall [SRS011] align processor state and congruent aligned memory locations.  Processor state includes all registers.  It also includes those timers used by FTSS.
The FCP shall [SRS296] configure ICP simplex virtual groups for each channel in the FCP virtual group.
The FCP shall [SRS297] wait up to 15 seconds, after configuring the ICP virtual groups, for communication to start from the ICP.  The application can use this time on the ICP to initialize I/O boards.
System Initialization shall [SRS215] call an application initialization function to allow the application to (at least) create tasks, create communication sockets, initialize the vehicle mode, and initialize memory alignment allowance.
The FCP shall [SRS221], after application initialization is complete, send an FCP Ready Sync message to the ICP
The FCP shall [SRS189] wait up to 2.5 seconds (from the sending of the FCP Ready Sync) for the ICP Ready signal.  Note that FTSS will not fail the FCR if this signal is not received within this time.  FTSS will wait until the normal ICP presence test fails.
The FCP shall [SRS243], if the NEFU ICP fails to send its ICP Ready signal, mask out that ICP, but continue to use the NE.
System Initialization shall [SRS199], when all other activities are completed, start the 50 Hz timer and enable the timer interrupt.  This will allow the interrupt handler to initiate normal activities.
System Initialization, from hardware reset to starting of the 50 Hz timer, shall [SRS015] take no longer than 1.5 minutes.

The scheduler shall [SRS029] report rate group over-runs to the application via an API service for incorporation in the telemetry data stream.
The scheduler shall [SRS216] provide an API call to specify which task was running within the rate group which over-ran.
The scheduler shall [SRS030] provide a mechanism to inform a task when it did not complete during the previous frame and restart it at the beginning of the task.
The scheduler shall [SRS181] set the 50 Hz interval timer to a count down value so as to cause the next minor frame interrupt at 20 msec from the previous interrupt congruently in all operational FCPs.
The scheduler shall [SRS032] issue a 50 Hz interrupt to the ICPs by means of a VMEbus IRQ5 interrupt.
The scheduler shall [SRS191] issue the 50 Hz interrupt to all the ICPs with a skew no greater than 330 microseconds.
The scheduler shall [SRS033] send the minor frame number, vehicle mode, mission elapsed time (MET), and separation elapsed time (SEP) to the ICP prior to the 50 Hz interrupt. Note: The NE unique identifier (NE ID) is available to the ICPs via the ftss_my_icp() API call.
The scheduler shall [SRS034] take no longer than 1 millisecond to execute scheduler and Time Services FTSS overhead tasks in each rate group.  This means that the time from the 50 Hz timer interrupt to the start of the first task in the 50 Hz rate group will be less than or equal to 1 millisecond, assuming 27 packets of data need to be delivered.
The FTSS software shall [SRS278] provide an API call that provides the application program the minor frame number.
The scheduler shall [SRS035] provide rate groups that execute at 50 Hz, 10 Hz and 1 Hz., with a drift rate no greater than 50 microseconds per second, and with a jitter no greater than 330 microseconds.
The scheduler shall [SRS037] provide a method to schedule tasks at a set rate and in a set order within the rate group.
The scheduler shall [SRS198] execute all the tasks in each of the rate groups that have been installed in the current mode.
The scheduler shall [SRS039] rely on the order used in adding tasks to a rate group to determine the task priorities.
The scheduler shall [SRS042] provide a method for a task to be scheduled as a 50 Hz "helper" task for source congruency input exchanges and voted output exchanges that starts in a particular minor frame but runs only during every 5th or 50th minor frame, effectively running at a lower, sub-rate, 10 Hz or 1 Hz, respectively.
The scheduler shall [SRS270] provide a task deadline capability that allows the application to specify which minor frame a task should start in and finish in.
Upon the occurrence of an exception of either kind (hardware or software), the FCP shall [SRS172] make the error type available to the application, via an API service, for incorporation in the telemetry stream and include all context data relevant to the exception, namely the contents of the Machine State Register (MSR), and the machine status Save/Restore Registers (SRR0 & SRR1).
The scheduler shall [SRS031] provide a mechanism for a task optionally to define a user written software-exception-handling routine that runs in the context of the task.
For hardware exceptions and reserved exceptions, the FTSS shall [SRS276] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then return from the exception handler to the task that was running when the exception occurred.
For software exceptions occurring within the FTSS, the FTSS shall [SRS277] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then restart the offending task at its beginning. 
For other software exceptions, regardless of whether or not a user written exception handling routine is invoked, if an exception occurs, the scheduler shall [SRS173], after making available the error type and context data to the application, resume processing (after the exception-handling routine runs, if provided) at the initialization point of the offending task.
For software exceptions occurring during Startup, FTSS shall [SRS301] issue a VME reset to the FCR in which the exception occurred.
Communication services shall [SRS047] provide "synchronous" message passing services in the form of "message queues".

Communication services shall [SRS050] restrict the use of "immediate" message passing services between virtual groups (from FCP to ICP) to tasks running in the highest rate group on the FCP. This restriction does NOT apply to the ICPs since they are running as simplex VGs.
Communication services shall [SRS051] detect message passing between application tasks living on the same virtual group and bypass the usage of the network element. 
Communication services shall [SRS052] route messages to the proper virtual group(s) and socket.
Communication services shall [SRS053] deliver messages in the same order at each member of a virtual group.
Communication services shall [SRS054] perform synchronous message passing at rate group frame boundaries. This ensures that all redundant instantiations of a given rate group task have consistent messages throughout the rate group frame.
Communication services shall [SRS235] detect a babbling NE or ICP within 20 milliseconds of the receipt of the first erroneous packet.
FTSS shall [SRS255] mask out a babbling NE or ICP within 40 milliseconds after it is detected.
Synchronous message passing sockets shall [SRS055] queue outgoing messages until they are transmitted at frame boundaries. The "create" and "open" API calls for synchronous sockets allow the application to specify the maximum message size and how many incoming messages the socket may buffer.
If there is insufficient space to enqueue a message for transmission, Communication services shall [SRS059] return an error to the corresponding task. Sockets are non-blocking and place the burden of polling on the application task.
Communication services shall [SRS062] provide a message queue communication mechanism that guarantees message delivery between a sending and receiving task.
Communication services shall [SRS063] provide an API for "message queue" communication.
Communication services shall [SRS064] provide the following error handling information as feedback to the "message queue" API calls: notification of invalid or out of range application specified parameters on all operations, notification of an attempt to create a broadcast message queue, message queue "open" of end point ( SENDER/RECEIVER ) by non-assigned virtual group, message queue is full when performing a send operation, connection/transmission error, FTSS unable to create/open message queue, and notification that a received message was truncated to the buffer size provided.
The message queue "create" API requires the application to specify the sending and receiving virtual group identifiers. Communication services shall [SRS066] only allow a single task living on each specified virtual group to "open" the respective end of the queue.
Communication services shall [SRS067] provide a "pipe" communication mechanism allowing immediate message passing through the network and allowing a 50hz FCP transfer task to poll until it can read an immediate message from the ICP.
Communication services shall [SRS068] provide an API for "pipe" communication.
Communication services shall [SRS069] provide the capability to create "pipe"s which "broadcast" their messages to all virtual groups.

If the broadcast option is used, each virtual group should open the pipe and read from it to avoid flow control problems.
The "pipe" "create" API requires the application to specify the sending and receiving virtual group identifiers. Communication services shall [SRS073] only allow a single task living on each specified virtual group to "open" the respective end of the pipe. In the case of a broadcast "pipe", communication services allows one task in each virtual group of the system to open the receiving end of the "pipe".

When the IBIT is complete, the FTSS in the channels that are part of the fault masking group shall [SRS239] report the results of IBIT for all Radstone boards to the application software for telemetry. 
In IBIT failure cases that cause processing to halt, the failure shall [SRS269] be handled as described in Section 3.2.6.2, Recovery. 
FTSS shall [SRS290], in ICP and FCP IBIT failure cases that allow processing to continue, after saving the results of IBIT for reporting to the application, in the first minor frame after Startup or recovery, consider the FCR to be failed, and start performing recovery actions for the FCR.

Redundancy Management shall [SRS101] define an initial mapping of physical hardware to virtual group identifiers consisting of 1 quadruplex FCP virtual group and 5 ICP simplexes.
If an FCR is diagnosed as faulty during Startup, Redundancy Management shall [SRS102] exclude the FCP in the faulty channel from the initial FCP virtual group configuration.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS104] implement the following strategies to reconfigure hardware resources: degrade the FCP virtual group, re-integrate an FCP processor into the FCP virtual group, re-integrate a Network Element, or mask a Network Element.
When the FCP virtual group is configured as a quadruplex and a failed FCR other than the NEFU has been diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS106] degrade the FCP virtual group to triplex, removing the FCR.  The NE and the processors on the failed FCR will be removed from the NEs’ Configuration Table (CT) and recovery of that channel will then take place, if alignment is permitted.  Note that a failed FCR could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) Continuous BIT, ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
When the FCP virtual group is configured as a triplex, and if the NEFU is still active (4 NEs active total), and a failed FCR other than the NEFU has been diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS282] degrade the FCP virtual group to degraded triplex, removing the FCR.  The NE and the processors on the failed FCR will be removed from the NEs’ Configuration Table (CT) and recovery of that channel will then take place, if alignment is permitted.  Note that a failed FCR could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) Continuous BIT, ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
If the FCP is configured as a triplex, and if the NEFU is not still active (3 NEs active total), and another failure in the FCP FCR is diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS284] mask out the processors on the failed FCR.  The NE will remain in the CT and no recovery will take place.  Note that a failed FCR could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) Continuous BIT, ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
If a failure in an FCR other than the NEFU is diagnosed when the FCP is configured as a degraded triplex, no action shall [SRS254] be taken.  Note that a failed FCR could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) Continuous BIT, ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
For the NEFU, if the first failure is diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS245] issue a configuration update to mask out the failed processor.  Note that the NE is allowed to remain in the configuration and no recovery will take place.  Note also that the failed NEFU could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
For the NEFU, if errors are identified after the processor has been masked out, and if at least 4 NEs are still active, the NE shall [SRS283] be removed from the configuration and recovery will be attempted.  Note that the NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.
If the configuration needs to be changed due to a fault, as specified above, Redundancy Management shall [SRS128] issue a configuration update to mask out the failed network element.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS109] degrade the FCP virtual group within 3 minor frames of fault detection and isolation.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS204] issue a voted reset to the failed channel, if alignment is permitted. (Note that NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.)
Redundancy Management shall [SRS129] initiate transient NE recovery to restore Byzantine-resilient communications, if alignment is permitted. (Note that NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.)
Redundancy Management shall [SRS110] reintegrate a failed FCP processor with the FCP virtual group when alignment is permitted and when the processor failure is not permanent.
From the time that the FCR failure has been identified, if the components of the FCR are recoverable and alignment is permitted, to the time the FCR is recovered, shall [SRS205] be no more than 1.5 minutes.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS208], within 60 milliseconds after 1.5 minutes has elapsed since the voted reset was sent to the failed channel, if the voted reset fails to recover the failed channel and alignment is still allowed, request from the application a power cycle of the channel. (Note that NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.)
Redundancy Management shall [SRS209], within 60 milliseconds after 1.5 minutes has elapsed since the first power cycle request, if the FCR has not been recovered and alignment is still allowed, issue another request to the application for a power cycle of the channel. (Note that NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.)
Redundancy Management shall [SRS211], if power cycle requests fail to result in a recovered channel, request the application to power down the channel and declare the channel to be permanently failed.  Note that the same result will occur if the application software ignores or fails to respond to power cycle requests.
The application software shall [SRS285] have the capability to reset a permanently failed channel to its initial recovery state.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS117] reintegrate a processor that is temporarily disabled during a time when alignment was not permitted, when alignment is subsequently permitted.  Redundancy Management picks up where it left off in these attempts.  For example, if Redundancy Management is at 1 minute in its 1.5 minute wait for a channel after the first power cycle request, and alignment is not allowed, when alignment is subsequently allowed Redundancy Management will wait another half minute and then try the next power cycle request.
An API call shall [SRS274] be provided that allows the application to notify FTSS that an FCR is intentionally being powered down.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS302] provide an API call to allow the application to specify whether recovery and alignment of failed FCRs is permitted.  Note that recovery of the NEFU is always considered to be permitted.

Redundancy Management shall [SRS281], during memory alignment, configure the NE to mask out the processor being re-synchronized.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS271] notify the application that alignment and reintegration of a processor will take place in 1 second.

During alignment, Redundancy Management shall [SRS126] update MET (and, by extension, SEP).
Redundancy Management shall [SRS214], if alignment is permitted, incorporate a new channel within 1.5 minutes after power is applied to the channel.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS236], if alignment is permitted, serially incorporate two new channels if they are powered on simultaneously.
The FTSS API shall [SRS046] define a methodology for segregating and managing congruent aligned, congruent initialized, and non-congruent memory such that congruent aligned memory is aligned and congruent initialized memory is initialized during channel recovery.  Non-congruent memory is not modified during realignment.
The FTSS API shall [SRS217] specify a memory map that provides the boundaries for congruent aligned memory, congruent initialized memory, and non-congruent memory.
Memory alignment shall [SRS045] align processor state and congruent aligned memory locations.  Processor state includes all registers.  It also includes those timers used by FTSS.

The utility timer shall [SRS247] have an accuracy equal to or better than 50 PPM.
The utility timer shall [SRS256] have a resolution equal to or better than 60.6 nanoseconds.

FTSS shall [SRS227] route messages to the proper virtual group(s) and socket.
If there is insufficient space to enqueue a message for transmission, FTSS shall [SRS228] return an error to the corresponding task. Sockets are non-blocking and place the burden of polling on the application task.
FTSS shall [SRS229] provide the following error handling information as feedback to the "pipe" API calls: notification of invalid or out of range application specified parameters on all operations, pipe "open" of end point ( SENDER/RECEIVER ) by non-assigned virtual group, notification upon receiving a message that the previous message was overwritten, connection/transmission error, FTSS unable to create/open pipe, and notification that a received message was truncated to the buffer size provided.
FTSS shall [SRS230] only allow a single task residing on each specified virtual group to "open" the respective end of the pipe.
The presence or absence of an NEFU ICP shall [SRS220] not impact the FTSS software (i.e. the FTSS ICP load will not be different).
The FTSS shall [SRS231] provide an API call to retrieve the current minor frame number sent from the FCP over the VME interface.  Note that the NEFU ICP will not have this information since it does not have an FCP processor.

The FCC hardware shall (3.2.1.1) use 3-digit binary numbers as outlined above for both addresses.
The X-38 NE shall (3.2.2.1.1) provide four types of data exchange primitives as described below, in accordance with the Byzantine-resilient replicated determinism requirements described in [1]. (Class 0, 1, 2, Broadcast)
The NE shall (3.2.2.2.1) keep track of the grouping of physical processors into virtual groups. This mapping is contained in the Configuration Table (CT).
The CT shall (3.2.2.2.2) also contain time-outs and vote masks.
It shall (3.2.2.2.3) be possible to modify the CT whenever any of this information is changed by using a CT update primitive in a synchronous and atomic manner.
The NE shall (3.2.2.3.1) be configured to automatically enter ISYNC microcode following power on.
The NE shall (3.2.2.3.2) start transmitting a sync message using class 2 exchanges once 3 fault tolerant clocks have synchronized, thus enabling inter-NE data exchanges.
 A time-out period shall (3.2.2.3.3) be started when 3 NEs have joined in.
The ISYNC procedure shall (3.2.2.3.4) terminate when all 5 NEs are synchronized, four NEs are synchronized (when only four NEs are powered), or after the time-out period.
The NE microcode shall (3.2.2.3.6) initialize the time-outs and vote masks in the NE CT using values stored in the NE.
The maximum time-out value shall (3.2.2.3.7) be 327.68 microseconds (256 counts of the least significant bit of the fault tolerant clock which is 1.28 microseconds).
An NE that fails to synchronize with other NEs during ISYNC after a pre-defined time-out period shall (3.2.2.4.1) then enter TNR microcode.
An NE shall (3.2.2.4.12) directly enter TNR microcode after a voted reset or an NE watchdog timer reset.
It shall (3.2.2.4.2) stay in TNR mode indefinitely until a successful TNR exchange is observed.
The operational NEs shall (3.2.2.4.3) enter a "working group" TNR routine when the FCPs request to send a TNR packet.
If no new NE is observed, the functioning NEs shall (3.2.2.4.6) return to the operational mode within 500 microseconds.
If there is a new NE, the state of the reintegrated NE shall (3.2.2.4.13) be made congruent with the state of the operational NEs as follows.
The Configuration Table shall (3.2.2.4.7) be exchanged and voted into the newly recovered NE.
Time-outs in the scoreboard shall (3.2.2.4.8) be aligned by resetting all time-outs.
The global synchronous timer shall (3.2.2.4.9) be realigned by exchanging and voting the timer value.  The timer value will stop incrementing until the realignment of the timer is complete.
Provided the failed NE is in a recoverable state, recovery of a failed NE shall (3.2.2.4.11) take no longer than 500 microseconds.  This recovery requirement includes the time from which the FTSS software initiates the recovery to the time the recovery is complete.
There shall (3.2.2.5.1) be built-in support on the NE for voted resets, including a special packet type for executing the primitive.
The NE shall (3.2.2.5.3) provide the capability to perform a voted VME bus reset.
The NE shall (3.2.2.6.1) place error syndromes in the input information block whenever a packet is successfully delivered to the FCP.
The NE syndromes shall (3.2.2.6.2) be located in the second longword of the input information block buffer cell.
The NE syndromes shall (3.2.2.6.3) include indications of vote errors, fault-tolerant clock synchronization errors, and fiber-optic link errors, as detailed below.
Each syndrome shall (3.2.2.6.4) represent an occurrence of the indicated error at some time between delivery of the previous packet and delivery of the current packet.
The scoreboard syndromes shall (3.2.2.6.5) be located in the third longword of the input information block buffer cell.
They shall (3.2.2.6.6) include indications of scoreboard vote errors, Output Buffer Not Empty (OBNE) time-outs, and Input Buffer Not Full (IBNF) time-outs, as follows.
When a majority, but not a unanimity, of FCP members are observed with packets in their output buffers, a time-out shall (3.2.2.6.7) be initiated.
If the time-out expires before the other members transmit the packet, the remaining member shall (3.2.2.6.8) be ignored, the packet exchanged, and an OBNE time-out recorded.
When a majority, but not a unanimity, of FCP members are observed with room in their input buffers, a time-out shall (3.2.2.6.15) be initiated.
If the time-out expires before the other members have room in their input buffers, any member without room in their input buffer shall (3.2.2.6.16) be ignored, the packet exchanged, and an IBNF time-out recorded.
The NE shall (3.2.2.7.1) place a timestamp in the input information block of each packet successfully delivered to an FCP or ICP.
The timestamps shall (3.2.2.7.2) be congruent across all members of the destination FCP.
The timestamps shall (3.2.2.7.3) also be congruent across all active processors in the case of a broadcast.
The timestamp shall (3.2.2.7.4) be a 32-bit quantity that indicates relative time within the FCC.
The resolution of the timestamp shall (3.2.2.7.5) be 1.28 microseconds.
When the timestamp counter reaches the maximum value (Hex FFFFFFFF or approximately 5500 seconds), it shall (3.2.2.7.6) wrap around to zero.
The timestamp counter shall (3.2.2.7.7) be initialized to zero during ISYNC.
The counter shall (3.2.2.7.8) increase monotonically after that, except during TNR.
The timestamps shall (3.2.2.7.9) be frozen during TNR until the realignment is complete.
The NE shall (3.2.2.8.1) implement in microcode support commands to aid in debugging new NEs and for performing stand-alone diagnostics and self-tests.
